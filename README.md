# Adsmurai Facebook Conversions API Tag

This Google Tag Manager custom tag for server containers helps with sending events to Facebook through Conversions API.

## Installation

This template is not available on the Community Template Gallery yet, so it has to be installed manually following these instructions:
- Download "template.tpl" from this repository.
- Open your GTM server container and click on "Templates".
- On "Client Templates", click "New".
- Click on the three dots in the top right corner, and then "Import".
- Open the file you downloaded on the first step.
- Once the importing is done, click "Save" and close the modal.

## How it works

This tag doesn't require any additional configuration, because all the set up is done on the Adsmurai Facebook Conversions API Client custom tag. However, you can change the Facebook Graph's API version to be used, if you want or need to.
